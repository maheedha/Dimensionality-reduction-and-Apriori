1) Copy the pca.ipynb code file to any folder in the desktop.
2) Copy the input data set into the same folder where the code file is present.
3) Open Jupyter notebook and open the pca.ipynb file.
4) Provide the name of the data set to the variable "inpu" in the line 103 of the pca.ipynb python note book.
5) Entire code is written in the single cell. So run the cell in the jupyter to get plots of PCA,SVD and T-SNE algorithms for the given    data sets.
6) 3 plots one each for PCA,SVD and TSNE will appear in the output of the cell.
