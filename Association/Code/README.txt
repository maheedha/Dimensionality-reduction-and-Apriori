1. To run apriori algorithm and rule generation, please include the following files in the directory where code is run:
a. associationruletestdata.txt - This contains dataset for running apriori algorithm
b. template1.txt - This contains queries for template1. Please don't change the format of the query
c. template2.txt - This contains queries for template2. Please don't change the format of the query
d. template3.txt - This contains queries for template3. Please don't change the format of the query

2. For Apriori Algorithm, please ensure the minsup percent (minimum support threshold) is set to the variable "minsup_percent" and for rule generation, please ensure that confup percent(minimum confidence threshold) is set to the variable "confup_percent".

3. All the outputs will be printed to the console. They are not written into any files.

Note: This code is built on python 3.6 and might show some unexpected behavior when run on earlier versions.
